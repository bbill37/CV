# Artificial Intelligence Graduate and Web Development Intern

I am a final-year B.CS. student specializing in Artificial Intelligence, currently excelling in a dynamic internship at XeerSoft until March 2024. My proven expertise spans AI, computer science, and web development, supported by hands-on experience in crafting AI solutions and contributing to the XeerSoft web administration projects. Throughout my internship, I have honed my skills in Golang, AngularJS, and database management tools, showcasing a strong commitment to problem-solving and delivering innovative solutions.

Certified in Google Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, Data Engineering, and Applications & Use Cases, I bring a holistic approach to technology. As I transition from an intern to a graduate, I am eager to leverage my diverse skill set and practical experience in a challenging role that contributes to a tech-focused organization's success.

A detail-oriented and collaborative team player, I possess strong communication and time management skills. I am excited about the prospect of contributing to and thriving in a dynamic professional environment after graduation.
