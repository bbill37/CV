# AI Graduate and Web Dev Intern

I'm a final-year B.CS. student specializing in AI, currently excelling in a dynamic internship at XeerSoft until March 2024. During my internship, I've sharpened skills in Golang, AngularJS, and databases, demonstrating a commitment to problem-solving.

Certified in Google Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, Data Engineering, and Applications & Use Cases, I bring a holistic tech approach. Transitioning from intern to graduate, I'm eager to apply my diverse skills in a challenging role that contributes to a tech-focused organization's success.

As a detail-oriented team player with strong communication skills, I'm excited about contributing to a dynamic professional environment post-graduation.
